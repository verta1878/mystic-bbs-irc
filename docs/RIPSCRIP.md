# RIPscrip in Mystic BBS (IRC fork)

How the fork's RIPscrip v1.54 support works — setup, file layout, detection,
and how .rip files flow from sysop to caller.

## What RIPscrip is

RIPscrip (Remote Imaging Protocol) is a graphical BBS protocol from 1992-1993
by TeleGrafix Communications. It gave BBSs a GUI before the web existed:
clickable buttons, vector graphics, icons, and mouse support — all over a
standard modem/telnet connection. RIPscrip commands are embedded in the same
byte stream as ANSI text, prefixed with `!|`.

The protocol was designed around Borland's BGI (Borland Graphics Interface),
so every RIP drawing command maps 1:1 to a BGI function: line, circle, bar,
fill, text, viewport, palette, etc. The native resolution is 640×350×16 (EGA).

## How it works in Mystic

Mystic's RIPscrip support is **server-side only** — the BBS detects whether
the caller's terminal supports RIP, and if so, sends `.rip` display files
instead of `.ans` files. The caller's RIP-capable terminal (e.g. RIPterm,
SyncTerm, mterm) handles all the rendering.

### Terminal modes

Mystic tracks three terminal modes in `Session.io.Graphics`:

| Value | Constant     | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0     | `TERM_ASCII` | Plain text, no escape sequences |
| 1     | `TERM_ANSI`  | ANSI/VT-100 color and cursor control |
| 2     | `TERM_RIP`   | RIPscrip v1.54 graphical terminal |

RIP is a **superset of ANSI** — a RIP terminal understands ANSI escape
sequences too. So all ANSI features (lightbar menus, color prompts, input
fields) work for RIP callers. The code uses `>= TERM_ANSI` checks throughout
instead of `= 1`.

### Auto-detection

When a caller connects, Mystic auto-detects their terminal:

1. First, it sends the standard ANSI detection query and checks for a response
2. If ANSI is detected, it then sends the RIP query command: `!|1Q00000000`
3. If the terminal responds with a string starting with `R` (the RIPscrip
   identification response), Mystic sets `Graphics := TERM_RIP`
4. Detection works for both remote (socket) and local (console) sessions

The detection mode is configured in `mystic -cfg` → General → Terminal:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Ask     | Prompt the caller for their terminal type |
| Detect  | Auto-detect ANSI, then RIP |
| Detect/Ask | Auto-detect first, then ask if detection fails |
| ANSI    | Force ANSI mode (skip detection) |
| RIP     | Force RIP mode (skip detection) |

### Display file resolution

When Mystic needs to show a display file (e.g. `welcome`, `logoff`, a menu),
it looks for files in this priority order for RIP callers:

1. `<textpath>/rip/<filename>.rip` — RIP version in the `rip/` subdirectory
2. `<textpath>/<filename>.rip` — RIP version alongside the ANSI files
3. `<textpath>/<filename>.ans` — falls back to ANSI if no .rip exists
4. `<textpath>/<filename>.asc` — falls back to ASCII

For ANSI callers, steps 1-2 are skipped (only .ans/.asc are checked).

### Raw .rip file sending

When a `.rip` file is found, Mystic sends it **raw** — no ANSI processing,
no MCI code expansion, no pause prompts. The file is piped byte-for-byte to
the caller's terminal. The RIP terminal handles all rendering (drawing
commands, button registration, mouse regions, icon loading, etc.).

This is the correct approach: RIP commands must not be mangled by ANSI
processing or line-wrapping. The `!|` escape sequences are meant for the
client's RIP parser, not the server.

### Menu display

The menu system (`ShowMenu`) checks for a `.rip` version of each menu:

1. If `Graphics >= TERM_RIP`, look for `<menupath>/<menuname>.rip`
2. If found, send it raw (same as display files)
3. If not found, fall back to the standard `.ans` menu display

This means a sysop can provide RIP menus for some screens and ANSI menus for
others — the fallback is seamless.

### MCI codes

Two RIP-related MCI codes:

| Code | Function |
|------|----------|
| `\|RI` | Sends the RIP reset command `!|*` to the caller (clears the RIP viewport and resets state). Only sent when `Graphics = TERM_RIP`. |
| `\|TE` | Returns the terminal type as text: `"RIP"`, `"Ansi"`, or `"Ascii"` |

### Door support

When launching external doors, Mystic's drop files report graphics capability
for both ANSI and RIP terminals (`GR` flag). This ensures doors that check for
ANSI support work correctly for RIP callers too.

## Directory layout

```
mystic/
├── themes/
│   └── default/
│       └── text/
│           ├── welcome.ans        ← ANSI version
│           ├── welcome.rip        ← RIP version (optional, same dir)
│           ├── rip/               ← dedicated RIP directory
│           │   ├── welcome.rip
│           │   ├── mainmenu.rip
│           │   └── ...
│           └── icons/             ← RIPscrip .ICN icon files
│               ├── button1.icn
│               └── ...
```

The `text/rip/` and `text/icons/` directories are created by the installer.

## Creating .rip files

RIPscrip files are text files containing `!|` escape sequences. They can be
created with:

- **mripcfg** — WYSIWYG RIPscrip scene editor
- **ripmake** — text-description to .RIP generator
- **ans2rip** — converts .ANS files to .RIP format
- **A text editor** — RIP commands are human-readable text

Example `.rip` file (draws a red line and a blue circle):
```
!|*
!|c04L0A0A3K3K
!|c01C1414050A
```

Line by line:
- `!|*` — reset the RIP viewport
- `!|c04` — set color to 4 (red)
- `!|L0A0A3K3K` — draw a line from (10,10) to (120,120) in base-36
- `!|c01` — set color to 1 (blue)
- `!|C1414050A` — draw a circle at (50,50) radius 186

## RIPscrip protocol reference

The full RIPscrip v1.54 protocol specification is included in the mterm
project at `docs/RIPscrip154.txt` (5,150 lines). Key points:

- **Arguments are base-36 encoded** (0-9, A-Z) in 2-character pairs
- **Level 0 commands** are single-character (drawing primitives)
- **Level 1 commands** are two-character (buttons, mouse, icons, text blocks)
- **Lines starting with `!` containing `|`** are RIP commands
- **All other lines** are plain text (ANSI terminal content)
- **Continuation**: a `\` before the line terminator joins the next line

## Configuration summary

| Setting | Location | Values |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Terminal mode | `-cfg` → General → Terminal | Ask / Detect / Detect-Ask / ANSI / RIP |
| .rip files | `<textpath>/rip/` or `<textpath>/` | any `.rip` file |
| .icn icons | `<textpath>/icons/` | RIPscrip icon files |
| RIP detection | automatic | sends `!|1Q00000000`, checks for `R` response |

## Companion: mterm

The fork includes **mterm** — a standalone RIPscrip v1.54 terminal written in
Free Pascal. It implements the full v1.54 command set (52 commands) using FPC's
native Graph unit (BGI), which is the exact API RIPscrip was designed for.
mterm connects via Telnet, COM port, or FOSSIL driver. See the mterm project
for details.
