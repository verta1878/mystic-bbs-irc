# mystic_test — RIPscrip Integration Testing

Test harness for porting the RIPscrip engine into the Mystic BBS codebase.

## Purpose

This directory contains integration tests and bridge code for connecting
`mystic_ripapi` (the standalone RIPscrip v1.54 engine) to the Mystic BBS
terminal I/O layer. The engine was developed standalone with zero MDL
dependencies — this directory handles the wiring.

## Integration Points

| Mystic Component | RIPscrip Hook | Status |
|------------------|---------------|--------|
| `m_term.pas` | Terminal output → ProcessLine | Pending |
| `m_pipe.pas` | Pipe code rendering → RIP commands | Pending |
| `m_socket.pas` | RIP data stream from remote | Pending |
| `m_inkey.pas` | Mouse/hotkey → FindButtonByHotkey | Pending |
| `m_output.pas` | Screen buffer → RIP pixel buffer | Pending |
| `mystic.pas` | RIP mode detection, init/free | Pending |
